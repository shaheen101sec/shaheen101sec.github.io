            i stared My journy in the Bug bounty world when i was 15 years, 
            <br>
            But when i started to learn about it i was 13 years old.
            <br>
            in some day i found a video explaining about how to do a phishing website,
            <br>
            and i did the same as he did in the video but i didn't understand what was he doing
            <br>
            and from here i started to learn about the hacking and websites and how it works 
            <br>
            and how i can create my own website.
            <br>
            after i learned about how the websites work and how can i create a website,
            <br>
            i started with the next level -the web applications vulnerabilities-
            <br>
            first i learned the owasp top 10 vulnerabilities, web pentesting tools, fuzzing, and more
            <br>
            after this i completed my journy with the portswigger academy labs
            <br>
            --it's the best web pentesting learning academy in the world--
            <br>
            and now i can test for 43 web vulnerabilitiy. i learned all of these for free and from my phone!,
            <br>
            if you beleve that you want to be what you want don't stop trying on it!.
            <br>
            even if you are young, i started when i was 13 years old.
            <br>
            My fav bugs is IDOR, JWT bypass, SSRF, XSS, OS command injection and SSTI.
            <br>
            My dream is to be the best bug bounty hunter in my country and the world!
            <br>
            <br>
            and in the end i want to say some thing for you!
            <br>
            if you like to be a bug bounty hunter and you love it or even any thing not just the bug bounty
            <br>
            don't let any thing stop you,
            <br>
